# p800-refunds-ui-tests
`<digital service name>` UI journey tests.  

## Pre-requisites

### Services

Start Mongo Docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo:4.4
```

Start `<digital service name>` services as follows:

```bash
sm2 --start <profile>
```

### Dockerized browser container(s)

Start a browser Docker container as follows:

* Argument `<browser>` must be `remote-chrome`, `remote-edge` or `remote-firefox`.

```bash
./run_browser_with_docker.sh <browser>
```

### Test inspection and debugging

Connect to `127.0.0.1:5900` via a VNC client to inspect and debug test execution.

If prompted for a password the default is `secret`.

## Tests

Run tests as follows:

* Argument `<browser>` must be `chrome`, `edge`, `firefox`, `remote-chrome`, `remote-edge` or `remote-firefox`.
* Argument `<environment>` must be `local`, `dev`, `qa` or `staging`.

```bash
./run_tests.sh <browser> <environment>
```

### Running ZAP tests

ZAP tests can be automated using the HMRC Dynamic Application Security Testing approach. Running 
automated ZAP tests should not be considered a substitute for manual exploratory testing using OWASP ZAP.

#### Tagging tests for ZAP

It is not required to proxy every journey test via ZAP. The intention of proxying a test through ZAP is to expose all the
 relevant pages of an application to ZAP. So tagging a subset of the journey tests or creating a 
 single ZAP focused journey test is sufficient.

#### Configuring the browser to proxy via ZAP 

Setting the system property `zap.proxy=true` configures the browser specified in `browser` property to proxy via ZAP. 
This is achieved using [webdriver-factory](https://github.com/hmrc/webdriver-factory#proxying-trafic-via-zap).

#### Executing a ZAP test

The shell script `run_zap_tests.sh` is available to execute ZAP tests. The script proxies a set of journey tests, 
tagged as `ZapTests`, via ZAP.  

For example, to execute ZAP tests locally using a Chrome browser

```
./run_zap_test.sh chrome local
```

To execute ZAP tests locally using a remote-chrome browser

```
./run_browser_with_docker.sh remote-chrome 
./run_zap_test.sh remote-chrome local
``` 

`./run_browser_with_docker.sh` is **NOT** required when running in a CI environment.

### Running tests using BrowserStack
If you would like to run your tests via BrowserStack from your local development environment please refer to the [webdriver-factory](https://github.com/hmrc/webdriver-factory/blob/main/README.md/#user-content-running-tests-using-browser-stack) project.

## Installing local driver binaries

This project supports UI test execution using Firefox (Geckodriver) and Chrome (Chromedriver) browsers. 

See the `drivers/` directory for some helpful scripts to do the installation work for you.  They should work on both Mac and Linux by running the following command:

    ./installGeckodriver.sh <operating-system> <driver-version>
    or
    ./installChromedriver <operating-system> <driver-version>

- *<operating-system>* defaults to **linux64**, however it also supports **macos**
- *<driver-version>* defaults to **0.21.0** for Gecko/Firefox, and the latest release for Chrome.  You can, however, however pass any version available at the [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/tags) or [Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/) repositories.

**Note 1:** *You will need to ensure that you have a recent version of Chrome and/or Firefox installed for the later versions of the drivers to work reliably.*

**Note 2** *These scripts use sudo to set the right permissions on the drivers so you will likely be prompted to enter your password.*

## Scalafmt

Check all project files are formatted as expected as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtCheckAll scalafmtCheck
```

Format `*.sbt` and `project/*.scala` files as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtSbt
```

Format all project files as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtAll
```
